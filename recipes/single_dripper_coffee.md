Single Dripper Coffee
=====================

Ingredients
-----------

440g hot water (1.8 cups)
20g coffee grounds (not too fine)

Instructions
------------

The trick is to get the water to go through the grounds slowly enough to pick up some flavor. The thicker the layer of coffee at
the bottom of the dripper, the slower the water will go. You can achieve this by pouring the water slowly around the edge of your
pile of grounds and avoiding pouring the water directly into the middle of you grounds. If the grounds get pushed up the sides of
the filter, you can push the grounds back to the bottom of the filter and pour the coffee through a second time.
